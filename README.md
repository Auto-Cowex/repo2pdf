# Repo-to-PDF

Repo-to-PDF is a tool that allows you to convert a GitHub repository into a PDF file. It clones the repository, processes the files, and then creates a PDF.



## Example PDF

<table>
  <tr>
    <td valign="top" width="40%">
      <p align="center">
        We have transformed the <a href="https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp">FreeCodeCamp</a> repository from 42,998 files into a 186,453-page PDF in under 2 minutes. This conversion is purely for example and stress testing purposes. All content belongs to the original authors at FreeCodeCamp.

## Installation

To use Repo-to-PDF, you have two options: cloning the repository from GitHub or installing it directly using NPX. Choose the method that suits you best.


### Installing with NPX
This will download and install the latest version of Repo-to-PDF from the NPM registry.

1. Install Repo-to-PDF using NPX:
```shell
npx repo2pdf
```

2. Run Repo-to-PDF:
```shell
repo2pdf
```


### Cloning the Repository

1. Clone the repository:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/BankkRoll/Repo-to-PDF
```

2. Navigate to the Repo-to-PDF directory:
```shell
cd Repo-to-PDF
```

3. Install the dependencies:
```shell
npm install
```

4. Build the script
```shell
npm run build
```

5. Run the script:
```shell
npm start
```


## Usage

Once you have installed Repo-to-PDF, you can use it to generate PDF files from GitHub repositories.

1. The script will install and start running. You will just follow the prompt:

You will be prompted to provide the following information:'
- Whether or not you want to clone a repository or use a local repository
  - The path to the local repository (if you chose to use a local repository)
  - The URL of the repository you want to clone (if you chose to clone a repository)
- Whether or not you want line numbers in the pdf
- Whether or not you want highlighting in the pdf
- Whether or not you want to remove comments from the code
- Whether or not you want to remove empty lines from the code
- Whether or not you want one big file or one PDF pr. file in your repo
  - When picking one big file you get 2 extra options:
    - Whether or not you want to add page numbers
    - Whether or not you want to add a table of contents (Coming in the future)
- The name of the output PDF file or output directory
- Whether or not you wish to keep the cloned repository after generating the PDF

The script will then clone the repository, process the files, and generate a PDF document based on the provided information.

Please note that you need to have Node.js installed on your system in order to run Repo-to-PDF.



## Configuration

Repo-to-PDF automatically ignores certain file types and directories (e.g., `.png`, `.git`). 
To customize the files and directories to ignore, you can add a `repo2pdf.ignore` file to the root of your repository.

Please note that if you use a local repository, the `repo2pdf.ignore` file must be in the root of the repository directory. And you might need to add more directories to the ignore list, as the script not automatically ignores different build files and directories.

### Example of file structure

```json
{
    "ignoredFiles": ["tsconfig.json"],
    "ignoredExtensions": [".md"]
}
```


## Troubleshooting / FAQ

**Q: I'm getting an error "Failed to install [package-name]". What should I do?**
A: Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed on your system. Try running the following command to install the required package manually:
```shell
npm install [package-name]
```

**Q: How can I customize the styling of the generated PDF?**
A: You can modify the code in `clone.ts` or `syntax.ts` to change the font, font size, colors, and other styling options for the PDF document.
